42filler

"Filler" is a game where you place randomly shaped pieces on a rectangle board.
Two players take turns and try to place as much pieces as possible while
trying to stop their opponent from placing more pieces than themselves.

This repo contains a ruby executable filler_vm, a game master who outputs board
state and gives pieces to play, and mperronc.filler, a C program that reads the
board state and gives a coordinate to play accordingly.

The goal of this project is to best other computer players at the game.
